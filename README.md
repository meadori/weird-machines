# Weird Machine Collection

This repo contains a collection of [weird machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_machine). Each machine has two things:

1. **Instruction Set Architecture:** - a defined set of instructions for what the machine can execute.
2. **Machine Card:** - a card describing the properties of the machine, such as what vulnerabilities it leverages.

Gotta Catch 'Em All!
